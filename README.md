# COVID-19 Data Analysis Queries
##Overview
This SQL project aims to analyze and derive insights from COVID-19 data by exploring various aspects such as:
•	Total cases, deaths, and death percentages
•	Infection rates and death counts by location and continent
•	Global case and death numbers
•	Vaccination rates compared to population
•	Relationships between cases, population density, and median age

## Code Structure
1.	Table Creation and Data Loading:
o	Code for creating tables (if needed) and loading data is included.
2.	Exploratory Queries:
o	Queries to explore data, calculate basic statistics, and compare different metrics.
3.	View Creation:
o	Views are created for storing frequently used calculations and results, aiding in visualization and further analysis.
## Key Queries and Views
•	Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Calculates death percentages for various locations and dates.
•	Highest Infection Rates: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to population.
•	Highest Death Counts: Shows countries and continents with the highest death counts per population.
•	Global Numbers: Provides total global cases, deaths, and death percentage.
•	Vaccination Rates: Compares total populations to vaccinations, calculating percentages of vaccinated populations.
•	COVID Spread: Explores relationships between cases, population density, and median age.

## Usage Instructions
1.	Prerequisites:
o	Access to a SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
o	Data sources loaded into your database
2.	Running Queries:
o	Execute queries in your SQL client to obtain results and insights.
3.	Visualization:
o	Use visualization tools to create charts and graphs based on query results.
## Further Analysis Opportunities
•	Time Series Analysis: Explore trends over time for various metrics.
•	Correlation Analysis: Investigate relationships between different factors (e.g., vaccination rates and death rates).
•	Predictive Modeling: Build models to forecast future trends or outcomes.
